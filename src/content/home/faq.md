  - question: "What makes your AI ads better than what I'm already using?"
    answer: "Our AI delivers high-converting, fully automated creatives tailored to your niche, tone, and audience. No templates — just precise, personalized marketing that adapts like an ad agency (but 10x faster)."
  - question: "Who is this for?"
    answer: "Small business owners, agencies, marketers, and creators who need high-quality ad creatives without spending hours or hiring expensive teams. If you're promoting online — this is for you."
  - question: "Do I need experience in marketing to use this?"
    answer: "No. Just tell us your niche and goal — our AI does the rest. It selects visuals, writes compelling copy, and applies smart ad psychology for better results."
  - question: "How is this different from hiring a freelancer or agency?"
    answer: "Agencies cost $300–$2000 per campaign. With us, you pay less than $2 per ad and get results instantly. Plus, our AI improves with each use — freelancers don't scale."
